/**
 *  Zebra_cURL, a high performance PHP cURL library
 *
 *  Zebra_cURL is a high performance PHP library acting as a wrapper to PHP's {@link http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php libcurl library},
 *  which not only allows the running of multiple requests at once asynchronously, in parallel, but also as soon as one
 *  thread finishes it can be processed right away without having to wait for the other threads in the queue to finish.
 *
 *  Also, each time a request is completed another one is added to the queue, thus keeping a constant number of threads
 *  running at all times and eliminating wasted CPU cycles from busy waiting. This result is a faster and more efficient
 *  way of processing large quantities of cURL requests (like fetching thousands of RSS feeds at once), drastically reducing
 *  processing time.
 *
 *  This script supports GET and POST request, basic downloads, downloads from FTP servers, HTTP Authentication, and
 *  requests through proxy servers.
 *
 *  For maximum efficiency downloads are streamed (bytes downloaded are directly written to disk) removing the unnecessary
 *  strain from the server of having to read files into memory first, and then writing them to disk.
 *
 *  Zebra_cURL requires the {@link http://www.php.net/manual/en/curl.installation.php PHP cURL extension} to be enabled.
 *
 *  The code is heavily commented and generates no warnings/errors/notices when PHP's error reporting level is set to
 *  {@link http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.error-reporting.php E_ALL}.
 *

     *  arguments, one or more files specified by the <i>$urls</i> argument, saves the downloaded files (with their original
